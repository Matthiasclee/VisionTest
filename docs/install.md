# VisionTest install

## Full install (VisionTest machines)
A full install will do everything automatically, and configure the computer to run VisionTest on startup.
To do a full install, first ensure you have sudo access on the target machine, and that it is running Ubuntu 20.04. Dependencies may not all get installed if it isn't running Ubuntu 20.04.

Start by downloading `scripts/linux_install.sh` script, and putting it on the target machine.
